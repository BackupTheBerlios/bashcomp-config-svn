README for bash-completion-config
A utility to easily add/remove bash completions to your environment.

bash-completion-config attempts to ease installation of contributed
bash completion scripts, and allows for both per-user and system-wide
installations.

To install, run:

    ./configure --sysconfdir=DIR1 --datadir=DIR2

where DIR# is the respective location.  These two directories *need*
to be set.

And that's it!  Running configure should've generated the script, a
manual page, and completion functions for bash-completion-config itself.
Install the completion functions (the file name 'completion') into
$datadir/bash-completion as bash-completion-config.

You can use bash-completion-config to install its own completion,
(as root) run:

    bash-completion-config -g -i bash-completion-config

If you installed the completion file elsewhere, you'll need to use
the full path to it.
