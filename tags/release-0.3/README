README for bash-completion-config
A utility to easily add/remove bash completions to your environment.
http://developer.berlios.de/projects/bashcomp-config

bash-completion-config attempts to ease installation of contributed
bash completion scripts, and allows for both per-user and system-wide
installations.

Installation

    ./configure --sysconfdir=DIR1 --datadir=DIR2

where DIR# is the respective location.  These two directories *need*
to be set.

And that's it!  Running configure should've generated the script, a
manual page, and completion functions for bash-completion-config itself.
Install the completion functions (the file name 'completion') into
$datadir/bash-completion as bash-completion-config.

You can use bash-completion-config to install its own completion,
(as root) run:

    bash-completion-config -g -i bash-completion-config

If you installed the completion file elsewhere, you'll need to use
the full path to it.

Running

To install a completion locally, run:

    bash-completion-config -i <completion>

If <completion> is just a name, it is assumed to exist in 
DATADIR/bash-completion.  Otherwise, it'll use the path that you specify.

Note that for the changes to take effect however, you will need to add the 
following to your ~/.bashrc:

[ -d ~/.bash_completion.d ] && \
{ for i in ~/.bash_completion.d/*; do [ -f $i ] && . $i; done }

Afterwards, "source" it, and the completion functions that you installed
should now be available.
