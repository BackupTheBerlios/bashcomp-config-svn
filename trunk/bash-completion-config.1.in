.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB%PACKAGE%\fR attempts to ease installation and configuration of contributed
(ie not include in bash-completion proper) bash completions and allows for both
per-user and system-wide (see --global) installations.

Perform specified operation on a system-wide basis.  Must be used in conjunction
with --install or --uninstall.
.TP
.B "\-l, \-\-list"
List currently installed completions (local and global).  This option takes an
optional argument, 'all', which if specified lists all completions, not just those
installed.
.TP
.B "\-i, \-\-install"
Install specified completion(s).  Takes an arbitrary number of completions to
install.  Each argument may be a path, or just a name, in which case it will
be assumed to exist in %DATADIR%/bash-completion.  Installs locally, unless
--global is previously specified.
.TP
.B "\-u, \-\-uninstall"
Uninstall specified completion(s).  Takes an arbitrary number of completions
to uninstall.  Each argument should be just the name of the completion.  
Uninstalls locally, unless --global is previously specified.
