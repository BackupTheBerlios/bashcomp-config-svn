    * Released 0.6
    Mainly fixes in Makefile install targets and a few other minor fixes.
    We're getting pretty close to being considered stable, and I'll probably
    be making the transition from 0.9 => 1.0 rather than 0.10, barring any
    extreme issues.

    * Released 0.5
    As far as user-visible changes, this is purely a bugfix release.
    Many thanks to James Rowe <Jay@jnrowe.ukfsn.org> for a couple fixes,
    plus a better Makefile.am.

    * Released 0.4
    Added minimal functions.sh for non-Gentoo platforms.  Added rc file
    support.  Lots of misc bug fixes, including one in --list where it
    would not list any completions installed by specifying a path.

    * Released 0.3
    Improved parsing of toggle options; doesn't matter if a toggle option
    is specified after an action option.  Added a no color switch (-nc,
    --nocolor).  Also, completely overhauled build process; using make to
    build stuff like we should.  make install now works.

    * Released 0.2  
    Improved --list action.  Better output and now accepts an optional 'all'
    argument.  Fixed bug where --global after --(un)install would attempt to
    install '--global' literally.
