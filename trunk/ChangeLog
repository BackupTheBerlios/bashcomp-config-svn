    * Released 0.3.
    Improved parsing of toggle options; doesn't matter if a toggle option
    is specified after an action option.  Added a no color switch (-nc,
    --nocolor).  Also, completely overhauled build process; using make to
    build stuff like we should.  make install now works.

    * Released 0.2.  
    Improved --list action.  Better output and now accepts an optional 'all'
    argument.  Fixed bug where --global after --(un)install would attempt to
    install '--global' literally.
